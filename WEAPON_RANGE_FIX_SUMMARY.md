# Weapon Range Validation Update - Summary

## Problem Fixed
The bot was attempting to attack chests at distance 3 with melee weapons that only had range 1-2, causing wasted actions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Weapon Range Helper Methods
- `getMeleeWeaponRange(Weapon)` - Returns accurate range for each melee weapon type
- `getGunWeaponRange(Weapon)` - Returns accurate range for each gun weapon type  
- `getThrowableWeaponRange(Weapon)` - Returns accurate range for each throwable weapon type
- `getMaxAvailableWeaponRange()` - Returns the maximum range among all equipped weapons

### 2. Updated Attack Logic in executeAction()
**Before:** All weapons attacked without range checking
**After:** Each weapon type now validates target distance against weapon range:

- **Melee weapons:** HAND/BONE = 1 range, KNIFE/AXE/TREE_BRANCH = 3 range, MACE = 3 range
- **Gun weapons:** SHOTGUN = 2 range, RUBBER_GUN = 6 range, CROSSBOW = 8 range, SCEPTER = 12 range
- **Throwable weapons:** SMOKE = 3 range, SEED = 5 range, BANANA/METEORITE/CRYSTAL = 6 range

### 3. Updated findChestInDirection()
- Now uses `getMaxAvailableWeaponRange()` instead of fixed distance 5
- Only considers chests within actual weapon range
- Provides better debug information showing weapon range vs target distance

### 4. Updated StrategicPlanner.planResourceGathering()
- Replaced hardcoded distance check (â‰¤ 3) with actual weapon range validation
- Calculates optimal weapon choice first, then checks if target is within that weapon's range
- Added static versions of range calculation methods for use in static planning methods

## Weapon Range Reference (from CSV data)
```
MELEE WEAPONS:
- HAND: 1*1 (range 1)
- BONE: 1*1 (range 1) 
- KNIFE: 3*1 (range 3)
- TREE_BRANCH: 3*1 (range 3)
- AXE: 3*1 (range 3)
- MACE: 3*3 (range 3)

GUN WEAPONS:
- SHOTGUN: 1*2 (range 2)
- RUBBER_GUN: 1*6 (range 6)
- CROSSBOW: 1*8 (range 8)
- SCEPTER: 1*12 (range 12)

THROWABLE WEAPONS:
- SMOKE: 1*3 (range 3)
- SEED: 1*5 (range 5)
- BANANA: 1*6 (range 6)
- METEORITE_FRAGMENT: 1*6 (range 6)
- CRYSTAL: 1*6 (range 6)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Bot will no longer attempt to attack targets beyond weapon range
- Better debug output showing "Chest too far for melee weapon - distance: 3, range: 1"
- Strategic planner will move closer to targets before attempting attacks
- More efficient resource gathering and combat targeting

## Test Output Example
```
Found chest at distance 3 in direction u, type: CHEST (max weapon range: 1)
Chest too far for melee weapon - distance: 3, range: 1
Moving towards chest: u (need to get within range 1)
```

The bot will now intelligently manage weapon ranges, preventing wasted attack attempts and ensuring more efficient gameplay.
