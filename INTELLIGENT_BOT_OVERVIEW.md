- **Dynamic Threat Evaluation**: Considers distance, enemy type, player health, and equipment
- **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipates enemy movements and danger zones

#### Weapon Priority Manager (Dynamic Programming)
- **Value-based Selection**: Uses pre-calculated weapon effectiveness scores
- **Context-aware Optimization**: Adjusts priorities based on current situation
- **Multi-criteria Decision Making**: Considers damage, range, effects, and pickup points

#### Path Optimization (A* Algorithm Enhanced)
- **Safety-weighted Pathfinding**: Integrates threat avoidance into path calculations
- **Strategic Positioning**: Finds positions with good visibility and escape routes
- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance**: Real-time updates to avoid new threats

#### Combat Strategy (Game Theory)
- **Engagement Decision Matrix**: Uses combat power calculations to decide when to fight
- **Optimal Weapon Selection**: Chooses best weapon based on range and situation
- **Target Prioritization**: Selects enemies based on threat level and vulnerability

#### Inventory Management
- **Value-based Optimization**: Calculates item values considering current needs
- **Space Efficiency**: Manages limited inventory slots optimally
- **Healing Strategy**: Prioritizes healing items based on efficiency and effects

### 3. Intelligence Features

#### Adaptive Behavior
- **Learning from Game State**: Adjusts strategy based on map size, time remaining, and enemy density
- **Dynamic Prioritization**: Changes focus between survival, combat, and resource gathering
- **Context-aware Actions**: Different behaviors for early, mid, and late game phases

#### Advanced Combat AI
- **Range-based Weapon Selection**: Automatically chooses optimal weapon for distance
- **Effect Utilization**: Leverages weapon effects like stun, poison, and knockback
- **Tactical Retreats**: Knows when to disengage from unfavorable fights

#### Strategic Map Control
- **Safe Zone Management**: Prioritizes staying in safe areas as the map shrinks
- **Central Positioning**: Maintains strategic positions for map control
- **Escape Route Planning**: Always maintains multiple escape options

#### Resource Optimization
- **Priority-based Collection**: Values items based on current needs and rarity
- **Equipment Upgrades**: Systematically improves loadout with better items
- **Healing Management**: Uses healing items efficiently to maintain health

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Action Throttling**: Prevents server overload with cooldown mechanisms
- **Efficient Pathfinding**: Optimized A* implementation with heuristics
- **Memory Management**: Efficient data structures for real-time processing

#### Error Handling
