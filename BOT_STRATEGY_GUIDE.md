# Bot Strategy Guide

## Game Phases and Strategies

### Early Game (First 5 minutes)
**Priority: Resource Gathering and Equipment**
- Focus on collecting weapons, especially guns (SHOTGUN, CROSSBOW priority)
- Gather healing items while inventory space allows
- Avoid combat unless absolutely necessary or clear advantage
- Stay in safe zone center for optimal positioning
- Prioritize armor collection (helmet and armor)

### Mid Game (5-1 minutes remaining)
**Priority: Strategic Positioning and Selective Combat**
- Maintain central map position for control
- Engage enemies only with combat advantage > 20%
- Use special weapons (MACE, ROPE) for tactical advantages
- Monitor dark zone progression and adjust positioning
- Optimize inventory - drop low-value items for better ones

### Late Game (Final minute)
**Priority: Survival and Opportunistic Combat**
- Stay in safe zone at all costs
- Use healing items aggressively to maintain health
- Engage only isolated enemies or when forced
- Prioritize positions with multiple escape routes
- Use throwables and special weapons for area control

## Weapon Usage Strategy

### Range-Based Selection
- **Long Range (6+ cells)**: Guns (SHOTGUN > CROSSBOW > SCEPTER)
- **Medium Range (3-6 cells)**: Throwables (CRYSTAL > METEORITE > BANANA)
- **Close Range (1-3 cells)**: Melee (AXE > KNIFE > BONE) or Special weapons
- **Point Blank (1 cell)**: Special weapons (MACE for stun) or strong melee

### Effect Utilization
- **STUN effects**: Use against multiple enemies or for escapes
- **POISON/BLEED**: Use for damage over time advantage
- **KNOCKBACK**: Use to create distance or push into hazards
- **PULL**: Use to separate enemies or reach strategic positions
- **INVISIBILITY**: Use for repositioning or avoiding combat

## Combat Decision Matrix

### Engage When:
- Our combat power > Enemy power Ã— 1.2
- Enemy health < 50 and we have ranged weapon
- Enemy is isolated from other threats
- We have tactical advantage (cover, high ground)
- Enemy is distracted by other threats

### Avoid When:
- Our health < 30
- Multiple enemies nearby
- No clear escape route
- Enemy has better positioning
- We lack appropriate weapons

## Resource Priority System

### High Priority Items
1. **Weapons**: SHOTGUN, MACE, CROSSBOW, CRYSTAL
2. **Armor**: Any armor when unequipped
3. **Healing**: UNICORN_BLOOD, PHOENIX_FEATHERS, ELIXIR_OF_LIFE
4. **Special Items**: COMPASS, ELIXIR (immunity), MAGIC (invisibility)

### Medium Priority Items
1. **Weapons**: SCEPTER, ROPE, SAHUR_BAT, METEORITE_FRAGMENT
2. **Healing**: MERMAID_TAIL, SPIRIT_TEAR
3. **Utility**: SMOKE (tactical), SEED (stun)

### Low Priority Items
1. **Basic weapons**: RUBBER_GUN, TREE_BRANCH, HAND
2. **Basic healing**: GOD_LEAF
3. **Situational**: BANANA, basic throwables

## Emergency Protocols

### Critical Health (< 30 HP)
1. Use best available healing item immediately
2. Move to nearest safe position
3. Avoid all combat
4. Stay in safe zone
5. Use defensive items (SMOKE for concealment)

### Surrounded by Enemies
1. Use area effect weapons (COMPASS, throwables)
2. Create escape path with KNOCKBACK weapons
3. Use SMOKE for concealment
4. Prioritize healing items
5. Move to nearest cover

### Dark Zone Approach
1. Calculate path to safe zone
2. Use healing items preemptively
3. Avoid combat during movement
4. Drop non-essential items for speed
5. Use special movement abilities if available

## Advanced Tactics

### Map Control
- Maintain position near map center when possible
- Control high-value resource spawn areas
- Use terrain for cover and tactical advantage
- Monitor enemy movement patterns

### Psychological Warfare
- Use area denial weapons to control enemy movement
- Create noise/distraction with throwables
- Use invisibility for unpredictable positioning
- Feint attacks to waste enemy resources

### Resource Denial
- Pickup valuable items even if not immediately needed
- Control healing item locations
- Deny armor to enemies by collecting first
- Use positioning to control weapon spawns

### Team Play Considerations
- Identify allied players (if any)
- Coordinate on high-value targets
- Share resources when beneficial
- Use allied players as shields/distractions

## Optimization Tips

### Performance
- Minimize pathfinding calculations
- Cache frequently used calculations
- Prioritize nearby threats over distant ones
- Use approximations for complex calculations

### Adaptability
- Monitor enemy behavior patterns
- Adjust strategy based on enemy skill level
- Adapt to map-specific features
- Learn from previous game outcomes

### Risk Management
- Always maintain escape routes
- Keep healing items in reserve
- Avoid unnecessary risks
- Balance aggression with survival
