# NPC Danger Zone Optimization - Fixed

## Problem
The bot was creating overly large danger zones (81 cells for a single NPC) by predicting movement in all 4 directions, making the bot too cautious and unable to navigate effectively.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Previous Logic (WRONG):**
- Predicted NPC movement in ALL 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
- Added 3x3 attack zones around EACH predicted position
- 4 directions × 2 steps × 9 cells per zone = 72 predicted cells + 9 current = 81 total

**Reality of NPC Movement:**
- NPCs move in straight lines and go back (patrol pattern)
- They don't move in all 4 directions simultaneously
- Much simpler and more predictable behavior

## Solution Implemented

### New Simplified Approach:
1. **Current Attack Zone:** 3x3 around NPC = 9 cells
2. **Safety Buffer:** 1-cell border around attack zone = ~16 additional cells  
3. **Total per NPC:** ~25 cells (vs previous 81 cells)

### Code Changes:
- Removed complex `predictNPCMovement()` method
- Simplified `calculateNPCDangerZone()` to only consider:
  - Current 3x3 attack zone around NPC
  - Simple 1-cell safety buffer around the attack zone
- Used `HashSet` to avoid duplicate cells

## Results Expected:

### Before Fix:
```
NPC GHOST at (10,10) creates 81 danger cells
NPC NATIVE at (15,20) creates 81 danger cells  
Total threat cells calculated: 500+ (for just a few NPCs)
```

### After Fix:
```
NPC GHOST at (10,10) creates 25 danger cells
NPC NATIVE at (15,20) creates 25 danger cells
Total threat cells calculated: 100-150 (much more reasonable)
```

## Benefits:
1. **Realistic Threat Assessment** - Matches actual NPC behavior
2. **Better Navigation** - Bot won't be paralyzed by excessive danger zones
3. **Performance Improvement** - Faster pathfinding with fewer cells to avoid
4. **More Aggressive Play** - Bot can get closer to resources without being overly cautious

## Danger Zone Breakdown:
- **3x3 Attack Zone:** 9 cells (immediate danger)
- **Safety Buffer:** ~16 cells (1-cell border for movement safety)
- **Total:** ~25 cells per NPC (70% reduction)

The bot should now be much more effective at navigating around NPCs while still maintaining appropriate safety margins!
